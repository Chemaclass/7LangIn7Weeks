# Haskell

> An advanced, purely functional programming language

## Features

- Statically typed
- Purely functional
- Type inference
- Concurrent
- Lazy
- Packages

## Monads

> In Haskell a monad is represented as a type constructor (call it m ), a function that builds values of that type ( a -> m a ), and a function that combines values of that type with computations that produce values of that type to produce a new computation for values of that type ( m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b ).

### What's the point?

1. Same idea works for other effects
2. Supports pure programming with effects
3. Use of effects explicit in types
4. Functions that work for any effect
