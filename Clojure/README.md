## Clojure

Clojure created by Rich Hickey in 2007.

Lisp created by John McCarthy in 1950's.

Later 'dialects' of Lisp added macros.

The simple syntax of Lisp makes its macros.

Clojure is dynamically typed and functional.

Imperative programming freely mutates state;
functional programming avoids mutable state.

"Pure" functions are truly modular.

---

A Clojure reference type holds mutable state that 
is coordinated across threads without locks.

Clojure compiles to Java bytecode, runs on the JVM,
and easily interoperates with Java code.

Clojure's approach to OOP removes inheritance and
encapsulation but embraces polymorphism.
